      <p> I'm an aspiring software engineer from New Orleans, Louisiana, where I was born and raised. 
      I've been out of Highshcool for a little less than a year now, and I've spent a lot of that 
      time building my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. At first I took a local bootcamp similar to FlatIron 
      called Operation Spark, but found it to be less rigorous than I'd like. My initial goal was to
      take the bootcamp as a gap year. Add a new skill to my arsenal, have something cool to put on my resume,
      something like that. But I quickly found that I really enjoyed coding, and decided to extend my gap year to
      pursue a software engineering bootcamp.</p>
      
      <p> On a less professional note, I enjoy video games, science, vr, and walking around my city. I'm not
      much of an extrovert, and spend a lot of time inside, but I do quite like talking to people. I really
      enjoy talking futurology with people. You can learn a lot about a person by how they talk and think about the
      future.</p>
